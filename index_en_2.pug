        p Each year, the Chest organises fund-raising events to benefit over 160 social welfare member agencies to support social services in six key areas: children & youth, elderly, family & child welfare, medical & health, rehabilitation & aftercare, and community development, benefitting over 3.5 million service users each year.
          br
          br
          |The Chest's administrative expenses come from a subsidised grant from our partner-in-charity, The Hong Kong Jockey Club, and return from prudent investment. This allows the Chest to allocate 100% of funds raised to charitable use; this operations model makes the Chest unique among its peers, and helps fulfil its mission to act as trustee of the donors.
